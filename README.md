### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on building the cybersecurity market intelligence observatory of the [National Cybersecurity Competence Center Luxembourg](https://nc3.lu/) and I occasionally lend a hand in translating content for [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/).
- 🌱 I am currently learning web development through the [Free Code Camp certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freecodecamp-certifications/) path focusing on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python. It also includes libraries and frameworks such as Bootstrap, React, or D3.js. You can see my progress and projects by clicking [here](https://github.com/gregWDumont/FreeCodeCamp_certifications).
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects.
