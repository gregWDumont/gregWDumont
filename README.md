### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on building the cybersecurity market intelligence observatory at the [National Cybersecurity Competence Center Luxembourg](https://nc3.lu/), and I also help out with translating content for [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/).
- ðŸŒ± In my free time, I'm studying web development through the [Free Code Camp certification curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freecodecamp-certifications/). I'm learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, as well as libraries and frameworks like Bootstrap, React, and D3.js. You can check out my progress and projects [here](https://github.com/gregWDumont/FreeCodeCamp_certifications).
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm always eager to expand my knowledge of computer science, so if you have any suggestions or want to collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out to me!
