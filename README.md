### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building the cybersecurity market intelligence observatory of the [National Cybersecurity Competence Center Luxembourg](https://nc3.lu/) and I occasionally lend a hand in translating content for [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/).
- ðŸŒ± I am currently learning web development through the [Free Code Camp certification curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freecodecamp-certifications/) focusing on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python. It also includes libraries and frameworks such as Bootstrap, React, or D3.js. You can see my progress and projects by clicking [here](https://github.com/gregWDumont/FreeCodeCamp_certifications).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to learn about anything related to computer science.
